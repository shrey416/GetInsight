#### **Skewness Checker Tab**
A dedicated section to analyze the asymmetry of your data's distribution.
* **Skewness Coefficient:** Calculates and displays the skewness value for the selected column, helping you identify if the data is left-skewed, right-skewed, or symmetric.
* **Distribution Histogram:** An interactive histogram that provides a clear visual representation of the data's distribution and skew.

#### **Correlation Heatmap Tab**
* **Automated Matrix Generation:** Creates a vibrant and easy-to-read heatmap showing the Pearson correlation coefficient between every pair of numeric columns in your dataset.
